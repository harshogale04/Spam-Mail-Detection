# 📧 Spam Mail Detection  

This project is a **Spam Mail Detector** that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab.

## 📌 Features  
✅ Preprocesses email text (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)  
✅ Extracts important text features using **TF-IDF** or **CountVectorizer**  
✅ Trains a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not  
✅ Evaluates the model using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**  

## 🗂 Project Files  
- `SpamMailDetection.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook with all code (preprocessing, training, evaluation)  
- `requirements.txt` → List of Python libraries required to run the project  


## 📊 Dataset  
This project is trained on a labeled dataset containing email messages marked as spam or non-spam. The dataset undergoes preprocessing for better accuracy.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **NLTK, Scikit-learn** (Text Processing & Machine Learning)  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**  

## 📌 Model Performance  
The model is evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** to measure classification effectiveness.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Improve accuracy with **deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers, etc.)**  
🔹 Deploy the model as a **web-based spam detector**  
🔹 Integrate with an **email API** for real-time classification
